				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>
					Hello! I'm Mustafa El-rashied, a teenage hobby developer passionate about creating solutions to help people better organize their time. At just 15 years old, I embarked on this journey with the goal of making a positive impact on others' lives through technology.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Why I made this app?</h2>
				<p>
					Inspired by my own struggles with time management, I decided to develop an app that simplifies the process of planning and prioritizing tasks. My hope is that this app will empower individuals of all ages to seize control of their schedules and achieve their goals more efficiently.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Thank you</h2>
				<p>
					Thank you for being a part of this journey with me. Your generosity and encouragement drive me to strive for excellence and make a meaningful difference in the lives of others. Together, let's make the most of our time and achieve great things!
