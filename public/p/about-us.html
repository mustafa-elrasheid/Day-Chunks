			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>
				Hello! I'm Mustafa El-rashied, a teenage hobby developer passionate about creating solutions to help people better organize their time. At just 15 years old, I embarked on this journey with the goal of making a positive impact on others' lives through technology.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Why I made this app?</h2>
			<p>
				Inspired by my own struggles with time management, I decided to develop an app that simplifies the process of planning and prioritizing tasks. My hope is that this app will empower individuals of all ages to seize control of their schedules and achieve their goals more efficiently.
			</p>

Every donation, no matter how small, helps fuel my passion for coding and motivates me to enhance the app's features and functionality.

			<h2>How we will use your feedback?</h2>
			<p>
				If you have any feedback, suggestions, or success stories to share, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to connect with me on social media or drop me an email. I'm always eager to engage with users and learn how I can make the app even better for you.
